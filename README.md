## Content
We provide a bootstrapped lexicon of English verbal polarity shifters.
Our lexicon covers 3043 verbs of WordNet v3.1 (Miller et al., 1990) that are single word or particle verbs.
Polarity shifter labels are given for each word lemma.

The data consists of:
1. Two lists of WordNet verbs (Miller et al., 1990), annotated for whether they cause shifting.
    1. The initial gold standard (ยง2) of 2000 randomly chosen verbs.
    2. The bootstrapped 1043 verbs (ยง5.3) that were labelled as shifters by our best classifier and then manually annotated.
2. Data set of verb phrases from the Amazon Product Review Data corpus (Jindal & Liu, 2008), annotated for polarity of phrase and polar noun.


## Verbal Shifters
### Files
  - The initial gold standard: `verbal_shifters.gold_standard.txt`
  - The bootstrapped verbs: `verbal_shifters.bootstrapping.txt`

### Format
- Each line contains a verb and its label, separate by a whitespace.
- Multiword expressions are separated by an underscore (WORD_WORD).
- All labels were assigned by an expert annotator.

## Sentiment Verb Phrases
### Files
- All annotated verb phrases: `sentiment_phrases.txt`

### Content
The file starts with 400 phrases containing shifter verbs, followed by 2231 phrases containing non-shifter verbs.
### Format
Every item consists of:
- The sentence from which the VP and the polar noun were extracted.
- The VP, polar noun and the verb heading the VP.
- Constituency parse for the VP.
- Gold labels for VP and polar noun by a human annotator.
- Predicted labels for VP and polar noun by RNTN tagger (Socher et al., 2013) and `LEX_gold` approach.
- Items are separated by a line of asterisks (*)
